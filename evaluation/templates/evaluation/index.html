<p>Welcome to the evaluation of the Semantic Tags for Open Data Portals - STODaP system. 
This tool was built to facilitate the access to open datasets and thus contribute to the development of open data. </p>

<p>Open Data is a worldwide movement towards turning public data more accessible and reusable. 
Hundreds of national governments around the globe are currently investing in publishing their datasets of public interest in open formats, i.e.: </p>

<ul>
	<li>Using open and machine readable formats (CSV, RDF, XML) instead of pdf;</li>
	<li>Licensing data so that it can be freely reused.</li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately, very little effort has been taken in metadata related to open data.
This is one the reasons that still hinders open data development.</p>

<p>The STODaP server aims to tackle this issue. 87 Open Data Portals were scraped in order to build the STODaP database, which is composed by 420.000 datasets and 290.000 tags. These data is semantically grouped in 3000 Global Tags, organized in 74 Global Groups. Global Tags and Groups are linked to the Linked Open Data cloud.</p>

<p>In this evaluation, we want to measure if STODaP is really an efficient tool for finding data. Can you help us?</p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<p>This evaluation consists of 3 tasks. They will be presented sequentially. Each task needs to be completed with one specific method: the STODaP server itself, the Exversion Data Search Engine, and your favourite internet search engine.</p>

<p>You have to find the specific datasets, paste the url in the fields and click the finish button. We are going to compute the time elapsed for each task, so please do it as quick as possible.
At the end, a short evaluation questionnaire will be presented.</p>
