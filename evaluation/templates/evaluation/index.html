<p>Welcome to the evaluation of the Semantic Tags for Open Data Portals - STODaP system. 
This tool was built to facilitate the access to open datasets and thus contribute to the development of open data. </p>

<p>Open Data is a worldwide movement towards turning public data more accessible and reusable. 
Hundreds of national and local governments around the globe are currently investing in publishing their datasets of public interest in open formats, i.e.: </p>

<ul>
	<li>Using open and machine readable formats (CSV, RDF, XML) instead of PDF;</li>
	<li>Licensing data so that it can be freely reused.</li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately, very little effort has been taken in enhancing metadata related to open data.
This is one the aspects that still hinders open data development.</p>

<p>The STODaP server aims to tackle this issue. Metadata of around 90 Open Data Portals were collected in order to build the STODaP database, which is composed by 420,000 datasets and 290,000 tags. These data is semantically grouped in 3,000 Semantic Tags, organized in 74 Semantic Groups. Semantic Tags and Groups are linked to the Linked Open Data cloud via the <a href="http://www.eionet.europa.eu/gemet/" target = "_blank">GEMET thesaurus</a>.</p>

<p>In this evaluation, we want to measure if STODaP is really an efficient tool for finding data. Can you help us?</p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<p>This evaluation consists of 3 tasks. After filling a short entry-questionnaire, the 3 tasks will be presented sequentially. Each task needs to be completed with one specific search method: the STODaP server itself, the Exversion Data Search Engine, and your favourite internet search engine.</p>

<p>You have to find the specific open datasets according to your task, paste the URL in the fields and click the finish button. Examples of open datasets are, for example <a href="http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/demographic-statistics-by-zip-code-acfc9" target="_blank">this</a> or <a href="https://data.gov.uk/dataset/crown-prosecution-service-major-projects-portfolio-data-2015">this</a>. We are going to compute the time elapsed for each task, so please do it as quick as possible and without interruption.
At the end, a short evaluation questionnaire will be presented.</p>
